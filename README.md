# SLWCrawler

A project to get familiar with basic Ruby.  
Things I've learned include:
- TTD using RSpec
- using VCR to record and playback http response for faster tests
- using anonymous struct for data class (judgment.rb)
- trying my best on immutability
- use Ruby CSV for basic data storage

## Usage

Include `SLWCrawler.rb` and call `SLWCrawler.serve_some_justice`
