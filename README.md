# SLWCrawler

A project to get familiar with basic Ruby.  
Things I've learned include:
- TTD using RSpec
- using VCR to record and playback http response for faster tests
- using anonymous struct for data class (judgment.rb)
- trying my best on immutability
- use Ruby CSV for basic data storage

### Usage

Run `ruby main.rb`, install missing gem as needed

## Issues

- Not multi-threaded, first run will always be slow
- Uses similar `judgment.rb` as [LNCrawler][LNC], should extract into separate project
